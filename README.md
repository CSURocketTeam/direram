## Installing

Make sure you have Java 11+ installed, running `java -version` in command prompt/shell should show something like `java version "11.0.8" 2020-07-14 LTS`

Download `GroundStation.exe` from the [releases](https://github.com/Kmschr/Aries-CoVId-Ground-Station/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha) page

If running `GroundStation.exe` doesn't work, you can try downloading and running the `.jar` file from the command line with `java -jar PATH-TO-JAR`
